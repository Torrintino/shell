# Shell

## Roadmap:

* Implement a minimal shell by following this tutorial: https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/
* Extend build in commands
* Implement pipes and redirection

Other interesting topics:
* Quoting
* Substitution
* History
* Configuration
* Control commands and signal handler

If I feel really adventurous I could actually implement a shell, that I want to
use and that really fits my personal needs and expectations. Before doing that,
it might be sensible to try out shells other than bash and look for good
code that is already existing (many shells are open source).
